# YOLOv8-detection-segmentation

# Dataset 
The data I used is available at kaggle [COCO 2017 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/coco-2017-dataset/data)

It was a great exercise of applying segmentation and detection of different objects in images using YOLOv8. 

## Detection

Here the yolov8 model detected and differentiated between 2 different objects, the car and the truck.

## Segmentation
For segmentation I created masks that describe the true shape of the object for higher accuracy:
